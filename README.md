# 📂 Google Drive Folder Structure

```text
Attendance Folder

│

├── 01-07-2026
├── 02-07-2026
├── 03-07-2026

```

Each file inside the folder is a Google Spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet filename follows:

```
DD-MM-YYYY
```

Example:

```
15-07-2026
```

---

# 📊 Spreadsheet Format

Each spreadsheet stores attendance records.

| Roll No | Student Name | Email | 9:15–10:15 (AI)| 10:15–11:15 (DL) | 11:30–12:30 (DBMS)| 12:30–1:30 (DSA) |
|----------|--------------|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 101 | Rahul | rahul@email.com | P | A | P | A |

Where:

- **P = Present**
- **A = Absent**

The first row represents lecture timings.

The second row represents subject names.

The AI Agent automatically maps lecture timings to subject names.
